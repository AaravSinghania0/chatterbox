## Acknowledgements

This project was made by following the brilliant tutorial by [Josh Tried Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXfg5Pxxh8)

## Note

-   This app is not at all bug-free or production-ready. For instance, the `groups` feature is not properly implemented. You might encounter bugs while trying to create, join or invite users to groups.
-   Although your email and messages are safe, I do not recommend sending sensitive or private information as a message.
